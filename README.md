# TrolleyFlow 2025  
**Optimizing GateGroup’s airline catering through intelligent automation and AI forecasting**

---

## Overview  
**TrolleyFlow** optimizes GateGroup’s catering operations by guiding operators with **real-time decisions** on alcohol bottles and other onboard items.  
It minimizes waste, ensures regulatory compliance, and transforms manual inspection tasks into a **smart, data-driven operation**.

---

## Key Features
- Intelligent decision system for **reuse, refill, discard, or replace** actions.  
- Airline-specific policies and regional compliance built into every workflow.  
- Forecasting API (built with **Google AI Studio**) to predict bottle usage and optimize supply.  
- Scanning interface for **Pick-and-packers**, reducing manual judgment and error.  
- Scalable architecture to extend beyond liquids — napkins, plates, and perishable items.

## Tech Stack  
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-------------|
| **Frontend / UI** | Figma Prototype |
| **Backend** | Python / Visual Studio Code |
| **AI Forecasting** | Google AI Studio |
| **Data Storage** | Excel + Custom Dataset |
| **Version Control** | GitHub |

---

## How It Works
1. The **Pick-and-packer** logs in and selects the assigned airline.  
2. The system loads the flight’s inventory and policies.  
3. Each bottle is scanned; the system recommends the correct action.  
4. Forecasting API predicts next-flight consumption and refilling needs.  
5. Decisions are logged for performance tracking and sustainability metrics.
